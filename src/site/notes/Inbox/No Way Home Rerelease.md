_Spider-Man: No Way Home: The More Fun Stuff Version_ is [what Sony calls the film’s extended cut](https://bgr.com/entertainment/spider-man-no-way-home-extended-cut-ticket-sales-have-been-delayed/), which has an official release date of September 2nd. The extended cut will feature additional content that has never been seen before. [Spider-Man fans in the US and some other countries](https://bgr.com/entertainment/spider-man-no-way-home-re-release-might-be-bigger-than-we-thought/) will be able to rewatch _No Way Home_ in theaters come mid-September.

The film’s plot remains unchanged. But _The More Fun Stuff Version_ will include additional _No Way Home_ scenes that were not part of the initial cut. As we get closer to the film’s theatrical rerelease, we have more details about it. For example, there’s a new poster for the film that finally features all three Spider-Men on it. But Sony didn’t cut an equally revealing trailer.

We were already talking about the biggest _No Way Home_ spoiler about a year ago. We knew Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield would join Tom Holland in the MCU’s third _Spider-Man_ movie. As we approached the December 17th, 2020 release date, we got incredible leaks that proved beyond a shadow of a doubt the two actors were in the film.

But Sony and Marvel chose not to use them for marketing purposes. And all the chatter about _No Way Home_ rumors worked. Sony sold nearly $2 billion in tickets for the latest _Spider-Man_ adventures. _The More Fun Stuff Version_ might get Sony past that $2 billion milestone. The film ended its initial theatrical run about [$100 million](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt10872600/) shy of the $2 billion mark.

## _The More Fun Stuff Version_ poster features all three Spider-Man variants

Fast-forward to late August 2022, and Sony is finally ready to use the three Spider-Man variants in promo materials for _No Way Home_. _The More Fun Stuff Version_ has a brand new poster that fans will love, featuring all three Spider-Man.

Sony also released a new trailer for the _No Way Home_ rerelease. However, unlike the poster above, the trailer doesn’t include any scenes with Maguire or Garfield. As much as it wants to build up hype around _No Way Home_, Sony decided not to bother featuring all three Spider-Men in new trailer.

The real surprises in _The More Fun Stuff Version_ extended cut will come from the extra Spider-Man footage that _No Way Home_ lacked.

We’ve known for a while that _The More Fun Stuff Version_ extended cut would feature various _No Way Home_ deleted scenes that have yet to be added to the digital versions of the movie. We thought [it would add up to around 15 minutes](https://bgr.com/entertainment/sony-rereleases-spider-man-no-way-home-as-the-more-fun-stuff-version/) of additional Spider-Man action. But [Fandango says](https://twitter.com/Fandango/status/1560676761276334081) it’s more like 11 extra minutes of Spidey content:

Of note, tickets should go on sale today, according to the tweet above.
