This question led to one of the earliest sectarian schisms in the Muslim community, between the Qadarites, who believed in absolute human free will (Allah has no control over us), and the Jabarites, who believed in absolute determinism and fatalism (we have no control over our actions). Each of these groups developed an extreme and misguided theology. If Allah has no control, then why call upon Allah in prayer? And if we have no control over our actions and fate, why do any good deeds at all?

Not only was this question a sharp controversy in early Islamic history, it has been an important issue throughout history for both religious and secular reasons. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle wrote seriously on the topic over two thousand years ago because of its implications for understanding order in the universe, the origin of life, human freedom, and happiness.

The Quran and Sunnah take a middle path between the two historical extremes, upholding both the sovereignty of Allah and the responsibility of humankind. From a purely rational standpoint, these two aspects seem mutually exclusive; in other words, it seems they cannot both be true. However, we have to remember that Allah exists outside of time and space, beyond the cosmic veil in the Unseen. By contrast, we human beings can only conceive of realities within the framework of time and space. Divine providence, or predestination, is a reality that exists beyond time and space, which means we are simply incapable of conceiving it with our limited rational faculties.

The term for divine providence in Islam is _Al-Qada' wa’l-Qadar_, literally "the decree and the measure." It is a combination of two terms, which signifies the dual aspects of providence. Ibn Hajar writes, “The scholars said the divine decree (_al-qada’_) consists of the entire and complete judgment forever, and the divine measurement (_al-qadar_) consists of the particulars of the judgment and its details.”

These two sets of texts seem contradictory on their face, yet they are two aspects of the same reality whose apparent contradiction is only the result of the human mind’s limited frame of reference. And each set of texts is reconciled towards the united purpose of guiding us to right behavior, with respect to Allah and to our fellow human beings.

Allah said:

> _Are you [Prophet] not aware that God knows all that is in the heavens and earth? All this is written in a Record; this is easy for God._

And the Prophet ﷺ said:

> _Verily, Allah Almighty created His creation in darkness and He cast over them His light. Whoever is touched by that light is guided, and whoever misses it is astray. Thus, I say the pens have been dried upon the knowledge of Allah._[](https://yaqeeninstitute.org/read/paper/reconciling-the-divine-decree-and-free-will-in-islam#ftnt7)

_The creation of each one of you is in his mother’s womb for forty days or nights, then as a clot for a similar period, then as a piece of flesh for a similar period, then the angel is sent to it to announce four decrees. He writes his provision, his life span, his deeds, and whether he is blessed or damned. Then, he breathes the soul into it. Verily, one of you acts with the deeds of the people of Paradise until he is not but an arm’s length away from it, yet the decree overtakes him, he acts with the deeds of the people of Hellfire and thus enters Hellfire. And one of you acts with the deeds of the people of Hellfire until he is not but an arm’s length away from it, yet the decree overtakes him, he acts with the deeds of the people of Paradise and thus enters it._

al-Bukhārī, Muḥammad ibn Ismāʻīl. _Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī_. (Bayrūt: Dār Ṭawq al-Najjāh, 2002), 9:135 #7454; Muslim, Ibn al-Ḥajjāj al-Qushayrī. _Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim_. ([Bayrūt]: Dār Iḥyāʼ al-Kutub al-ʻArabīyah, 1955), 4:2036 #2643.

_Be mindful of Allah and He will protect you. Be mindful of Allah and you will find Him before you. If you ask, ask from Allah. If you seek help, seek help from Allah. Know that if the nations gather together to benefit you, they will not benefit you unless Allah has decreed it for you. And if the nations gather together to harm you, they will not harm you unless Allah has decreed it for you. The pens have been lifted and the pages have dried._

>  al-Tirmidhī, _Sunan al-Tirmidhī_, 4:248 #2516; declared authentic (_ṣaḥīḥ_) by al-Tirmidhī in his comments.

Notice that in this hadith, the Prophet ﷺ informed us, through his companion Ibn Abbas (ra), that the decree has already been made. The pages have been dried. Even so, the Prophet ﷺ prescribed action: to be mindful of Allah and to seek help from Allah.

Ibn Abi al-‘Izz continues:

_The origin of the error is from equating between the will of desire and the will of enacting, and between love and pleasure. Thus, the Jabarites and the Qadarites equate them both, then they disagree. The Jabarites said all of existence is by decree and measure, so it is loved and pleasing to Allah. The Qadarites said sinful disobedience is not beloved and pleasing to Allah, so it cannot be ordained and decreed by him; it is outside of His will and creation. Yet the distinction between what is willed and what is loved has been made in the Book, the Sunnah, and sound instinct._[](https://yaqeeninstitute.org/read/paper/reconciling-the-divine-decree-and-free-will-in-islam#ftnt12)

And Ibn Taymiyyah, the Hanbali jurist and theologian, writes:

> _Among what was agreed upon by the predecessors of this nation and its leaders regarding their faith in the divine decree and providence, is that Allah created all things, that what He wills comes to be and what He does not will cannot come to be, that Allah misguides whomever He wills and guides whomever he wills, and that the servants have will and ability, acting upon their ability and their will according to what Allah has enabled for them. Indeed, the servants do not will unless Allah wills._[22](https://yaqeeninstitute.org/read/paper/reconciling-the-divine-decree-and-free-will-in-islam#ftnt22)

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> _Good works protect from evil fates. Charity in secret extinguishes the wrath of the Lord, maintaining family ties increases lifespan, and every good deed is charity. The people of good in the world are the people of good in the Hereafter, and the people of evil in the world are the people of evil in the Hereafter. And the first to enter Paradise are the people of good._[](https://yaqeeninstitute.org/read/paper/reconciling-the-divine-decree-and-free-will-in-islam#ftnt23)

al-Ṭabarānī, Sulaymān ibn Aḥmad. _al-Muʻjam al-Awsaṭ_. (al-Qāhirah: Dār al-Ḥaramayn, 1995), 6:163 #6086; declared authentic (_ṣaḥīḥ_) by Al-Albānī in _Ṣaḥīh al-Jāmi’ al-Ṣaghīr_ ([Dimashq]: al-Maktab al-Islāmī, 1969), 2:708 #3796.

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> _Whoever is pleased to have his provision expanded and his lifespan extended, then let him keep good relations with his family._[25](https://yaqeeninstitute.org/read/paper/reconciling-the-divine-decree-and-free-will-in-islam#ftnt25)

al-Bukhārī, _Ṣaḥīh al-Bukhārī_, 8:5 #5985.

_Nothing repels the divine decree but supplication, and nothing increases lifespan but righteousness._[](https://yaqeeninstitute.org/read/paper/reconciling-the-divine-decree-and-free-will-in-islam#ftnt27)

And Abu Huraira (ra) reported,

>     _The Prophet ﷺ would seek refuge in Allah from the evil of the divine decree, from falling into misery, from his enemies rejoicing at his misfortune, and from a difficult trial._[30](https://yaqeeninstitute.org/read/paper/reconciling-the-divine-decree-and-free-will-in-islam#ftnt30)


 Muslim, _Ṣaḥīh Muslim_, 4:2080 #2707.

Our predecessors understood that whatever came to be—positive or negative—was from the decree of Allah. In one instance, Umar (ra) departed for Syria and when he arrived, they found that a plague had broken out, so Umar announced that they would return to Medina. Abu Ubaidah questioned him, saying, “Do you flee from the decree of Allah?” And Umar replied:

> _Would that another had said so, O Abu Ubaidah! Yes, we are fleeing from the decree of Allah to the decree of Allah. Do you not see that if you had camels descending in a valley with two fields, one of them fertile and the other barren, you would graze in the fertile field by the decree of Allah or you would graze in the barren field by the decree of Allah?_[34](https://yaqeeninstitute.org/read/paper/reconciling-the-divine-decree-and-free-will-in-islam#ftnt34)

al-Bukhārī, _Ṣaḥīh al-Bukhārī_, 7:130 #5729.

People often mistakenly assume that trusting in Allah’s decree means we should not act, like a person who does not wear his car’s safety belt, thinking it has no effect on what Allah chooses to ordain. But Umar’s example shows us that real trust in Allah means one should act upon the pattern of causes we observe in daily life.

> _If he does so, then it was from the decree of Allah, and avoiding what harms him has been commanded. Allah ordains its occurrence while he flees from it. If he did it or left it, it would be from the decree of Allah. Hence, there are two perspectives: the perspective of reliance upon Allah and the perspective of holding to causes._[35](https://yaqeeninstitute.org/read/paper/reconciling-the-divine-decree-and-free-will-in-islam#ftnt35)

Ibn Ḥajar, _Fatḥ al-Bārī_, 10:185.

And this is the correct understanding of divine providence. We understand that the world is full of causes and effects, so we pursue the causes of a good fate, while we acknowledge that it is not the causes in themselves that we rely upon. The Prophet ﷺ said, “There is no contagion,” which recognizes that all diseases are allowed to happen by the will of Allah, and at the same time he ﷺ said, “Do not mix those who are sick with those who are healthy,” thereby acknowledging the role of worldly causes in the treatment of illness.[38](https://yaqeeninstitute.org/read/paper/reconciling-the-divine-decree-and-free-will-in-islam#ftnt38)

With this understanding, it is only Allah upon whom we depend to bring these good causes about. Every action we intend in the future should be qualified as only occurring under the will of Allah, because we know by our will and ability alone it will not happen.

Ibn Taymiyyah writes:

> _The servant has two states of being in relation to what is decreed: a state before the decree and a state after the decree. It is a duty upon him before the decree to seek refuge in Allah, to depend upon Him, and to call upon Him. If the result of the decree is not from his actions, then he must be patient over it and satisfied with it. If it was the result of his actions and it is a blessing, he praises Allah for that. If it was the result of sin, then he seeks forgiveness from Him for that._

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> _If something befalls you, then do not say, ‘If only I had done something else.’ Rather say, ‘Allah has decreed what he wills.’ Verily, the phrase ‘if only’ opens the way for the work of Satan._[42](https://yaqeeninstitute.org/read/paper/reconciling-the-divine-decree-and-free-will-in-islam#ftnt42)

 Muslim, _Ṣaḥīh Muslim_, 4:2052 #2664.

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> _None will enter Paradise but that he will be shown the place he would have occupied in Hellfire if he had done evil, so that he may be more thankful. None will enter Hellfire but that he will be shown the place he would have occupied in Paradise if he had done good, so that it may cause him sorrow._[](https://yaqeeninstitute.org/read/paper/reconciling-the-divine-decree-and-free-will-in-islam#ftnt45)

 al-Bukhārī, _Ṣaḥīh al-Bukhārī_, 8:117 #6569.

In the end, divine providence is an enigma due to our limited ability to conceive of realities beyond time and space, and beyond physical causes and effects. It is a mystery in its essence, as free will and providence are an apparent contradiction. It is also a mystery in its details, as we often cannot directly discern the hidden wisdom behind the catastrophes and evil that Allah allows to happen.

As a result, the scholars emphasized that providence is a secret of Allah and that going too deeply into it philosophically will lead to misguidance.

The creed of Al-Tahawi states:

> _The principle of providence is the secret of Allah Almighty in His creation that has not been given to an angel near Him, nor to a prophet or messenger. Exaggeration (al-ta’ammuq) and debate regarding it leads to failure, progressive denial, and a degree of transgression. Take every precaution against that kind of debate, thinking, and insinuation._

Consequently, the Prophet ﷺ prohibited his companions from arguing about providence. On one occasion when they were arguing about the issue the Prophet ﷺ was angered and said:

> _With this I have commanded you? With this I was sent to you? Verily, the people before you were destroyed when they argued over this matter. I am determined for you not to argue over it._[](https://yaqeeninstitute.org/read/paper/reconciling-the-divine-decree-and-free-will-in-islam#ftnt49)

As such, the principle according to the great Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal is to accept providence as it comes, believing in “its good and its evil, affirming the narrations regarding it and having faith in them without asking why or how.”

Ibn Hajar quotes Al-Sam’ani as saying:

_The way of knowledge in this topic (of providence) is to suspend judgment (al-tawqif) at the Book and the Sunnah without resorting to pure analogy or reason. Whoever turns away from stopping (at the texts) will be misled and will stray into a sea of confusion. He will not achieve what heals the mind, nor what satisfies the heart, for providence is a secret among the secrets of Allah Almighty._

. Although the words are familiar to us and the general meaning is plain, the deeper realities are inconceivable. In the same way, we understand the simple reality of providence through the literary images of the Pen, the Preserved Tablet, and the records of deeds. Any investigation after this is impossible and will lead us astray.

Divine providence is one of the six articles of faith in Islam, yet it was one of the first concepts to be disputed, leading to sectarianism in the early generations. The apparent conflict is between the sovereignty of Allah and the responsibility of humankind. Unable to reconcile these two realities, the Qadarites and the Jabarites weighed one idea over the other, each producing an incomplete theology.

The Quran and Sunnah follow a middle path between the two extremes. Allah is sovereign over the universe, knows all things before they happen, and decrees them into existence with limitless power. At the same time, Allah delegated will to human beings to test their deeds, culminating in the Day of Judgment.




“Indeed, Allah leaves astray whom He wills and guides to Himself whoever turns back [to Him]” [ar-Ra‘d 13:27]

I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) being asked about it and the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah created Adam, then He passed His right hand over his loins and brought forth from him some offspring and said: ‘I have created these for Paradise and they will do the deeds of the people of Paradise.’ Then He passed (His hand) over his loins and brought forth from him some (other) offspring and said: ‘I have created these for Hell and they will do the deeds of the people of Hell.’”

A man said: O Messenger of Allah, why then should we strive?

The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, creates a person for Paradise, He causes him to do the deeds of the people of Paradise until he dies doing one of the deeds of the people of Paradise, and He causes him to enter Paradise thereby. And when He creates a person for Hell, He causes him to do the deeds of the people of Hell until he dies doing one of the deeds of the people of Hell, and He causes him to enter Hell thereby.”

Imam at-Tirmidhi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This is a hasan hadith. Muslim ibn Yasaar did not hear [directly] from ‘Umar. Some of them stated that in this isnaad, between Muslim ibn Yasaar and ‘Umar there is a man who is unknown (majhool).

This hadith does not contradict the fact that Allah is merciful and forgiving, or that He, may He be glorified, is just. There is nothing in it to indicate that man is compelled to do anything. Rather this is the prior will and decree of Allah (predestination). Allah, may He be exalted, knew and decreed all that would happen, and nothing happens beyond the framework of what He has decreed.

But no person knows what has been decreed and, moreover, man has free will and the ability to act upon it. If he wishes he may believe and if he wishes he may disbelieve; if he wishes he may obey Allah and if he wishes he may disobey Him. No person feels that anything is forcing him to do anything. This is what is meant by free will. So man has no right to say that he was predestined to be guided or misguided, and he has no excuse for relying on fate (what he is predestined to do) when he does not know anything about it; rather Allah is the Creator and undoubtedly knows that. So how can anyone think that Allah, may He be exalted, created His slave and does not know what course of action he will take or where he will ultimately end up?

All that man has to do in this life is to try his best and strive hard, without worrying or thinking: is this decreed for me or not? For he will never be able to answer this question.

But when he knows that everything happens by the divine will and decree (predestination), he will feel reassured if calamity strikes and will not despair or say: if only I had done such and such, then such and such would have happened. This is the meaning of the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):

“No disaster strikes upon the earth or among yourselves except that it is in a register before We bring it into being - indeed that, for Allah, is easy -

In order that you not despair over what has eluded you and not exult [in pride] over what He has given you. And Allah does not like everyone self-deluded and boastful”

[al-Hadeed 57:22-23]

Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, sends astray whomever He wills, and He guides whomever He wills, as He, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):

“and Allah sends astray [thereby] whom He wills and guides whom He wills. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise”

[Ibraaheem 14:4]

Our advice is that you should strive to attain the deeds of the people who are blessed (destined for Paradise), and you should not let your mind be preoccupied with the issue of the divine will and decree (predestination), because this is a divine secret that Allah has kept from His creation. So strive to do what you are enjoined to do, which is to believe and do righteous deeds, and leave what you are not enjoined to do, which is to find out about the subtleties of the divine will and decree.

[Belief in al-qadar](https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12380) (the divine will and [decree](https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11522) ) is one of the pillars of faith. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, when he answered Jibril’s question about faith: “(It means) believing in Allah, His angels, His Books, His Messengers and the Last Day, and to believe in [al-qadar](https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34732) (the divine decree) both good and bad.”

“And with Him are the keys of the Ghayb (all that is hidden), none knows them but He. And He knows whatever there is in the land and in the sea; not a leaf falls, but He knows it. There is not a grain in the darkness of the earth nor anything fresh or dry, but is written in a Clear Record” [al-An'am 6:59]

“No calamity befalls on the earth or in yourselves but it is inscribed in the Book of Decrees (Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz) before We bring it into existence. Verily, that is easy for Allah” [al-Hadid 57:22]

“Verily, We have created all things with Qadar (Divine Preordainment of all things before their creation as written in the Book of Decrees Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz)” [al-Qamar 54:49]

Muslim (2653) narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘As said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “Allah wrote down the decrees of creation fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth.” He said: “And His Throne was upon the water.”

Al-Jahm went to extremes in affirming the divine will and decree, and claimed that people are compelled to do what they do and have no choice. This is a false view.

The belief of Ahl al-Sunnah wa'l-Jama'ah is that a person has [freedom of will](https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11282) , and hence he will be rewarded or punished. But his will is subject to the will of Allah, and nothing can take place in the universe that is not willed by Allah.

What some people say, that we have the choice to follow whatever path we want but at the end of this path you will find what Allah has decreed for you, is a correct view. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“Verily, We showed him the way, whether he be grateful or ungrateful” [al-Insan 76:3] 

“And shown him the two ways (good and evil)?” [al-Balad 90:10] 

“And say: “The truth is from your Lord.” Then whosoever wills, let him believe; and whosoever wills, let him disbelieve” [al-Kahf 18:29]

“People act in a real sense, and Allah is the Creator of their actions. A person may be a believer or a kafir, righteous or immoral, he may pray and fast. People have control over their actions, and they have their own will, and Allah is the Creator of their control and will, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“To whomsoever among you who wills to walk straight. And you cannot will unless (it be) that Allah wills, the Lord of the ‘Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists)” [al-Takwir 81:28-29]” (al-Wasitiyyah ma’a Sharh Harras, p. 65)

Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked this question and said: The questioner should ask himself whether anyone forced him to ask this question, and does he choose the kind of car that he drives? And other such questions. Then the answer as to whether he is following a course set by Allaah or has freedom of choice will become clear to him.

Because His Lordship (ruboobiyyah) is complete and perfect, nothing can happen in the heavens or on earth except by His will. 

With regard to things that happen to a person or that he does without choosing or willing them, such as sickness, death and accidents, they are purely divine will (al-qadar) and the person has no choice or will with regard to them.

Based on that, whoever says “I am in charge of my destiny,” meaning that he does not submit to the decree of Allah, or that he is able to change or evade what has been decreed, or he means that he does not believe in the divine decree, then undoubtedly this is wrong and it is clear misguidance, because it is contrary to belief in this important pillar of faith.

But if he is referring to free will and choice, and means that he does whatever he wants, and does not feel that he is compelled to do a particular deed, or that he does not depend or rely on what is written, which is unknown  to him – rather he works and strives to the best of his ability – then this is true, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): _{And say, “The truth is from your Lord, so whoever wills - let him believe; and whoever wills - let him disbelieve”} [al-Kahf 18:29]_ and _{And [We] have shown him the two ways} [al-Balad 90:10]_ – that is, We have shown him the path of good and of evil.


 Hence Imaam al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) entitled a chapter in his Saheeh “Whoever seeks refuge with Allaah from having an evil end to this worldly life and from having a bad fate, and the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): ‘Say: I seek refuge with (Allaah) the Lord of the daybreak, from the evil of what He has created’ [al-Falaq 113:1-2].” Then he quoted the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Seek refuge with Allaah from the difficulties of severe calamities, from having a bad end and bad fate.” (al-Bukhaari, 7/215, Kitaab al-Qadar).

Now as we all know, God is all-powerful, and he is all knowing. Now if God possesses these attributes, and possesses these attributes to perfection, which is what we would expect from God, then he would naturally know everything that happens before they happen by virtue of his all knowing perfect knowledge. God does not need to wait until you do something for him to learn about it, if that were the case, that God didn’t know what you would do until you do it, this would then mean that God is not all knowing, and if God is not all knowing and is not perfect in his knowledge then he cannot be God. So again, based on the fact that God’s knowledge is perfect, that he knows everything, this means he also knows what you will do before you even do it because his knowledge is perfect.

Now even though God has already recorded everything that will happen, again this is based on his perfect attribute of knowledge, you yourself are not privy to that recorded document. So while God knows what you will do today, tomorrow, and next week, you yourself do not know. Hence people cannot use this as some excuse that their free will is somehow determined and they can’t really do anything because what will happen will happen, indeed what will happen will happen, but you don’t know what will happen now do you? Hence what happens is based on your choices, you can’t simply put your hands up and say ‘well hey my actions have already been recorded so who cares’ because you have no idea about your future actions, at the end of the day it’s your choices that are being made that lead to the actions you are doing.
