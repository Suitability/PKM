# FDA Confirms Toxic Nonstick Cookware Chemicals Are Contaminating Our Food and Water Supply

The agency has been conducting studies on the prevalence of PFAS—a common chemical ingredient in nonstick pans—in various food and water sources.

PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), a group of about 5,000 synthetic compounds, are present in [the blood of 98 percent of the U.S. population](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2072821/ "(opens new window)"), and research shows our diets are the main source of exposure to these hazardous substances.

The agency explained that these chemicals that have been widely used in nonstick cookware, contact paper, food packaging, cleaning products, and other industrial products have leached into our food and water supply, as well as contaminated our livestock and the sewage sludge used for fertilization.

This is a serious problem as these “forever chemicals” are [linked to](https://www.cdc.gov/biomonitoring/PFAS_FactSheet.html "(opens new window)") liver damage, certain types of cancers, thyroid disease, infertility, high cholesterol, obesity and several other health conditions.

Exposure to PFAS chemicals is [associated](https://www.ewg.org/research/ewg-proposes-pfas-standards-fully-protect-children-s-health) with serious health risks, including cancer, reproductive harm, developmental harm, high cholesterol, damage to the immune system, hormone disruption, and liver and kidney damage.

In a related study, the FDA detected the PFAS chemical GenX and highly elevated levels of numerous other PFAS in samples of leafy greens grown within 10 miles of a PFAS production facility.

The EPA noted that livestock can accumulate PFOS from eating contaminated feed or grazing on fields where biosolids were applied. PFOS also appeared in the majority of fish tested from hundreds of sites across the U.S.

PFAS can also [migrate into fruits, vegetables](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es500016s) and [grains](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24184376) that are [irrigated](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/es504150h) with PFAS-contaminated water or grown in [soils](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27792944) that are contaminted with PFAS.


Nonstick coatings (like Teflon) were originally made with a common PFAS that is no longer allowed to be produced, but the replacement chemicals may not be any safer.
